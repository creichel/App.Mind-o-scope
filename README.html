<h1 id="analternativemindmapvisualization-inspiredbymicroscopes">An alternative Mind Map visualization - inspired by Microscopes</h1>

<p>This is a Web-App that converts a Mind Map Freemind-file into a zoomable Venn-diagram visualization with features like search, a better zooming experience, an online share mechanism and much more.</p>

<h1 id="interaction">Interaction</h1>

<p>Simply select the node in which you want to zoom in. Alternatively you can also select the parent node in the path heading or a node in the hierarchy tree list.</p>

<p>I made and used monster-sized, careful crafted and structured Mind Maps for my Bachelor study and liked the way how it helps me to visually structure everything I know (and I have to know). It helps me a lot to remember very special term by deriving its association to more meta-like topics and terms.</p>

<p>But monster Mind Maps always have one issue: nobody but me wants to read them because they&#8217;re not good enough to explore them easily. Also it was kind of hard to share the PDF or some kind of Freemind-file. A more scientific reason is that monster-sized Mind Maps are demotivating people to read and explore them. So this is a try to do it a different way.</p>
