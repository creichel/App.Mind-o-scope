<p><img src="mind-o-scope.png" alt="The Mind-o-scope User Interface" title="The Mind-o-scope User Interface" />
This is a Web-App that converts a Mind Map Freemind-file into a zoomable Venn-diagram visualization with features like search, a better zooming experience, an online share mechanism and much more.</p>

<h1 id="interaction">Interaction</h1>

<p>Simply select the node in which you want to zoom in. Alternatively you can also select the parent node in the path heading or a node in the hierarchy tree list.</p>

<h1 id="theimplementation">The implementation</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s mainly based on the awesome <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a> framework. This helps me a lot to visualize the Mind Map. The upload drag-and-drop area is based on <a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com">dropzone.js</a>. The introductions is made with <a href="http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/">intro.js</a>.</p>

<h1 id="demo">Demo</h1>

<p>Look to this demo Mind Map (it&#8217;s based on the German cat Wikipedia article): <a href="http://app.mind-o-scope.com/demo">Katzen Mind Map</a>.</p>

<h1 id="thestorybehind">The story behind</h1>

<p>I made and used monster-sized, careful crafted and structured Mind Maps for my Bachelor study and liked the way how it helps me to visually structure everything I know (and I have to know). It helps me a lot to remember very special term by deriving its association to more meta-like topics and terms.</p>

<p>But monster Mind Maps always have one issue: nobody but me wants to read them because they&#8217;re not good enough to explore them easily. Also it was kind of hard to share the PDF or some kind of Freemind-file. A more scientific reason is that monster-sized Mind Maps are demotivating people to read and explore them. So this is a try to do it a different way.</p>
