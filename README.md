# 3D-Mindmap-visualisation
This is (or will be) a website which visualizes complex .freemind files in 3D with WebGL. I want that everyone could dive into and through the whole mindmap to understand the connections between two or more terms or topics in a big picture.

# Interaction
As a real *dive in* (ba-dumm tss) you only know one direction: the z-axis. So the main idea is that the depth of every term or topic is visualized as a depth in z-axis. The camera can't rotate to look back or do any other stuff. That's the idea behind it. 


# The story behind
I've learned a lot in the course "Interactive Computer Graphics" - especially in 3D graphics. For the exam I've created about 22 mindmaps and one connecting mindmap. But viewing this giant map of informations costs me a lot zoom in and out interaction and a lot of time. 
A 3D visualisation could help me to think less about the interaction with this giant map and much more about what I have to learn.

# What's the real 3D deal behind this?
I don't want to visualize the informations with bubbles or anything else. I hate 3D bubbles with visually printed text on. Think about a mindmap with christmas tree balls - very cool, huh? No, it's not.

The real 3D deal in this whole thing is the visualisation in a "room" with informations. The text will still be in 2D but if any rotation should be added in a future version the text would always look to the camera.
